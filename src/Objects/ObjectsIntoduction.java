package Objects;

public class ObjectsIntoduction {

}
/*
Java allows us to create objects in computer using classes
Class --> type or blueprint for an object.
Data types in Java
1.Primitive;
Primitive data types are able to store ONLY one piece of info
int i = 6;

2.Object;
--> Objects data types are able to store many pieces of information
objects types are able to store not only pieces of information , but they can store behaviors of objects

    We can create Objects using Classes

    1.We have to create a class and set the rules for it;
    2.Create an object for it;
    String name = "James";
    name.indexOf("m");

    *CLASS HAS TWO THINGS
    1. DATE FIELDS, ATTRIBUTES, INSTANCE VARIABLES, PROPERTIES
    2.BEHAVIORS, METHODS

    ex:

    public class Dog{

    String name;  ---> instance variables;
    int age;
    String color;
    double weight;
    String breed;

    public void bark(){
    System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }


    }
